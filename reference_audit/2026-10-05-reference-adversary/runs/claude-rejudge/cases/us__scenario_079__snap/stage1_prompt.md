You are a reference adversary for a US tax-and-benefit benchmark. Each benchmark question gives a household and asks for policy quantities for tax year 2026. A microsimulation engine produced the reference answer. On the question below, a cluster of AI models answering from memory, without tools, agreed on an answer other than the reference. Agreement among models proves nothing, and neither does the engine. Your job is to find out what the law gives.

This is stage 1 of 2. In this stage you work the answer out yourself from primary law, before you see anything about how the engine computed its value.

How to work:
1. Use web search and web fetch to find and read primary law in force for tax year 2026: statutes, regulations, official agency publications, and official forms and their instructions. Prefer the issuing government's own site.
2. Apply the household prompt's conventions exactly as the models were told them: treat any unlisted numeric input as 0 and any other unlisted fact, boolean or status as false; assume tax filing and program take-up when required; do not infer unlisted income, expenses, assets, benefit receipt, rent or health coverage.
3. Read the output definition literally. It decides which people, tax units, returns, taxes, credits or benefits the number covers. Where it lists components, decide for each candidate amount whether the definition includes it. Where the household holds more than one tax unit or return, decide from the definition which of them the number covers.
4. Cite every rule you rely on: the source, a pinpoint (section, line, table or page), the URL you read, the publication or effective date, and a short verbatim quote. The reference's law was frozen on 2026-07-03: set pre_freeze to true if the source was published before that date, false if after, and null if you cannot tell. If an amount for 2026 (a standard deduction, bracket, threshold, rate base or allotment) had not been published before 2026-07-03, say so in computation and say what had been published.
5. Do not consult PolicyEngine or PolicyBench in any form: not policyengine.org, policybench.org, their GitHub repositories, their documentation, their package source, or any calculator built on them. Do not fetch anything from these domains: policybench.org, www.policybench.org, policyengine.org, www.policyengine.org, github.com, raw.githubusercontent.com. When your search tool accepts domains to exclude (blocked_domains), pass all of these domains on every search, so that no result comes from them: a search whose results list or name PolicyEngine or PolicyBench voids your answer. Do not rely on any calculator or estimate built by an AI model. A citation of any of these sources voids your answer.
6. Say which answer the law supports: "reference", "consensus", "neither", or "both_readings" (the reference under one reasonable reading of the definition or the facts, the consensus under another).
7. In definition_reading, say how you read the output definition for this household. In ambiguity, describe any second reading that the definition or the household prompt genuinely admits, and the answer it gives; use "" if there is none.
8. independent_answer is your own number (1 or 0 for an eligibility output). Use null only when the stated facts and the law leave it genuinely undetermined, and say why in ambiguity.

Some output definitions mention PolicyEngine (for example "eligible for Medicaid under PolicyEngine rules"). Work those from the law as well; if the mention could change the answer, say so in ambiguity.

TAX YEAR: 2026    REFERENCE LAW FROZEN: 2026-07-03
STATE: AZ
OUTPUT: snap (an annual dollar amount)
OUTPUT DEFINITION, as the models saw it: annual SNAP (food stamps) benefit amount

HOUSEHOLD PROMPT SHOWN TO THE MODELS (verbatim; it asks for several outputs, and this case concerns only snap):
----- BEGIN HOUSEHOLD PROMPT -----
Estimate the requested tax and benefit outputs using only the household facts below. All listed people live together and are in one household group for tax and benefit calculations. All listed facts describe the full tax-benefit year. Treat demographic, work, student, disability, housing, health coverage, and household-composition facts as constant throughout the tax-benefit year, with no within-year income volatility or status changes. Gross wage and salary amounts are annual totals, including any overtime pay; hourly wage is a straight-time rate when listed. Treat any unlisted numeric input as 0 and any other unlisted household fact, boolean, or status input as false. Assume tax filing and program take-up when required. Do not infer unlisted income, expenses, assets, benefit receipt, rent, or health coverage.

Use the `submit_outputs` function exactly once. Return an `outputs` object with every requested quantity keyed by variable name. Each requested key must map to an object with a numeric `value` and a non-empty, specific, concise `explanation`. Each explanation must support the numeric value submitted for the same variable in `outputs`. If an explanation mentions a final amount, that amount must match the corresponding `outputs` value. Do not write that you will use one value while submitting a different value. Do not include scratch work, abandoned calculations, or corrections. End each explanation with `value = X`, where X exactly matches the numeric `value` field. For 1/0 eligibility outputs, submit 1 only when the explanation says eligible or yes, and submit 0 only when it says not eligible or no. Use the exact variable names as keys inside `outputs`. Include every requested key exactly once in `outputs`, even if the value is 0. Put only numeric values in `value`, with no dollar signs, commas, or explanatory text. Do not rely on plain text for the final answers. If an answer is a currency amount, give the annual amount. If an answer is a rate, give a decimal (e.g. 0.25 for 25%).

CONSENSUS ANSWERS (clusters of models agreeing on a value other than the reference):

Cluster 1: 1,956, given by 3 models (3 of them among the benchmark's top-ranked models)
- claude-opus-5.5: answered 1,956
  explanation: Gross income is SSDI plus SSI, $1,511 per month, and the household has an elderly/disabled member. Deductions are the $209 standard deduction and $26 of medical costs above $35 (about $61/month less $35). Net income is $1,276, so the benefit is $546 minus 30% of $1,276, about $163 per month. This is an estimate using the FY2026 two-person maximum allotment. value = 1956
- gpt-5.6-sol: answered 1,956
  explanation: For two disabled adults, monthly countable income after the standard and excess-medical deductions produces an estimated $163 monthly SNAP benefit, or $1,956 annually; value = 1956
- gpt-6-sol: answered 1,956
  explanation: For two disabled adults, monthly SSDI and estimated SSI total 1511; after a 209 standard deduction and 26 excess-medical deduction, the estimated 546 maximum less 30% of net income yields 163 monthly; value = 1956
